win_ptr is the pointer to a window. This window will register for the given event.

func_ptr is a pointer to a function that returns an int and that takes undefined parameters.
Beware, (*func_ptr)() is not the same as (*func_ptr)(void): 
the last means NO argument while the first means "any set of arguments".

param is the address of an element you would want to access in your func_ptr 
when you'll be handling events. The minilibx doesn't use param whatsoever,
that's just a way to help you pass arguments.
